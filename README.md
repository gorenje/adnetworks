Adtek.io Adnetworks
===

Dealing with Mobile Advertising Networks can be a non-trivial task, especially
when it comes to integrating them into reporting tools: each has their own
report APIs, each of which return their own report-data format.

On top of that, each has its own authentication methods, making it difficult
to obtain the right credentials for the right report. Where possible, this
gem provides scrapers for adnetworks to obtain API credentials in a transparent
and common manner.


Importers
---

- [Spends importers][simp] which retrieve spending reports from
  various networks.
- [Revenue importers][rimp] which retrieve revenue reports from various
  adnetworks.

API Key Scrapers
---

[API Key Scrapers][apsc] aim to obtain the API credentials using the login
details of the adnetwork. That is to say, they automate the retrieval of
API credentials from adnetworks where possible.

So when an adnetwork says something like: ```To obtain your API key, first
login, then go to your profile page, then click API key ...``` etc, a
scraper will automagically do that to obtain the API credentials.

Integration
---

To include the gem in your project, add this to your favourite Gemfile:

```
gem 'adtekio_adnetworks', :github => "adtekio/adnetworks"
```

then run bundle and require the gem:

```
require 'adtekio_adnetworks'
```

Usage
---

You can play around with the gem by cloning it and then running a
[pry][pry] shell:

```
git clone git@github.com:adtekio/adnetworks.git
cd adnetworks
bundle
rake shell
```

Ideally your using either [rbenv][rbenv] or [rvm][rvm] to isolate your ruby
versions and gemsets.
